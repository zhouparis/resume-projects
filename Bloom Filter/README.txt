To run the code you need the bitarray, math, and hashlib libraries for python.

you can install it from the terminal with 
pip install <library> 

ex.
pip install bitarray 

Other than that, 
python is required, 
the preloaded dictionary.txt is required, 
preloaded rockyou.ISO-8859-1.txt is required and renamed to rockyou.txt. 

Apologies in advance, I did not have a virtual environment when I created my reqirements.txt so the needed modules may be excessive.
